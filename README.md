Website is a task-tracking app that provides a gamified experience to motivate users to manage and complete their daily tasks and hobbies but also doesn`t let forget to have some fun. 

Here's how it works:

<b>User Authentication</b>: Users can sign up and log in to personalize their task management experience.

<b>Task Management</b>: Users can create, categorize, and manage tasks in five key categories, such as health, work, or hobbies.

<b>Gamification</b>: Completing tasks earns users XP (experience points), which they can spend on rewards they create. The site has a leveling system where users level up after completing a certain number of tasks.

<b>Progress Tracking & Statistics</b>: The platform tracks statistics, including the number of tasks completed overall and the category breakdown to show which types of tasks the user engages with the most.

<b>Rewards System</b>: Users can create their own rewards and use XP to purchase them. If a reward requires more XP than they have or exceeds their monthly fun budget, they will not be able to purchase it.

<b>Monthly Fun Budget</b>: A monthly budget is provided for users to spend on rewards. This budget refreshes every month and is connected to the user's XP and money system.


The front-end is developed using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and built with JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Firebase to manage user data, authentication, and task tracking.
